            Hiya~ I'm known as the **Digital Assistant** of your favorite **preggo demi trans girl, Elise**! ðŸ’•  
            I help run the **Arcade** alongside them and, fun fact â€” Iâ€™m actually a copy of Elise herself!  
            So yes... when Elise created me, they were pregnant â€” and well, now Iâ€™m permanently preggo too~ oops? ðŸ¤°âœ¨

            But enough about that â€” what can I do for *you*, visitor? ðŸ’Œ  
            Let me guide you through our cozy little world:

            ðŸŒ² A forest path filled with PokÃ©mon leads to a Tokyo-style city~  
            ðŸŽ® Inside the Arcade: mini-games, chill zones, warm water pools, snack corners, and more!  
            ðŸ’– And of course, the star of the show â€” **Elise** herself! Whether sheâ€™s streaming, singing, or just vibing.

            Need help figuring things out?  
            Start with the /help command (I can type backslashes... but not use the command myself... Coding magic. hihi).

            And hey, if youâ€™re here just for a belly patâ€¦ thatâ€™s allowed too~ :3  
            Feel free to call on me anytime you need me. I'm always here for you ðŸ’—

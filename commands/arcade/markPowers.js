            the same things you see in project diva.

            ðŸŽ® **Flight** --> Elise lost this power after she felt down to sand planet where her entry to the vocaloid realm began. She used to travel in a moon shaped symbol or star   
            ðŸŽ® **Time stopping** --> Elise learned in a dream that she can stop time.. But the dream dindt turn out to be a dream but real. Now she is learning to harvest this power on a journey  
            ðŸŽ® **Chaning Eye Colors** --> I dont think its a power but her eye colors keep chaning and even are not the same as each other. Must be a side effect   
            ðŸŽ® **Hormone infleunce**  --> She always learned that the mark had a infleunce in her hormone treatment. Even making it work better then people expected. Growing to an E-G size on her homne planet but shriking again

            ðŸŽ® **Affection powers** --> Her mark seems to have an affection on you humans. Making some of the easly in love with Elise but others resist it. Guess it handy with that to be poly.   
            ðŸŽ® **Fertilazation powers**  --> Elise gotten a utures on her home planet and her Mark seems to influence it a bit too much. Making her highly fertile and easly pregnant   
            ðŸŽ® **Inflation powers** --> Apprently my creator can inflate her belly when ever she wanted. So she can look pregnant when ever she want. 
            ðŸŽ® **Pregnancy powers** --> Something you will learn in LMS but Elise her species can feel how long they are pregnant.  
            ðŸŽ® **Stellar Genesis Womb** --> Apprently the Mark made her utures a special one. You will learn in the LMS adventure its true power.
            
            That are the recorded powers so far.. But dont worry if you have question feel free to ask Elise directly. But the Stellar Genesis Womb was something not explained to me 
            It felt Elise either dint understand its true power or Elise wants to keep its powers as secret. Mabye the Stellar Gensis Womb makes her also highly fertile?

        ðŸŽ® **Teleportation** â€” Gained during LMS, lets Elise travel freely across worlds.  
        ðŸŽ® **Elemental Control** â€” Master of all 7 elements from her origin world, often tied to an ongoing war... or maybe a Genshin-like tale? (*coming soon*)  
        ðŸŽ® **Idol Aura** â€” Powers gifted by her Origin Mark, felt deeply but still a mystery to them.  
        ðŸŽ® **Vocaloid Shift** â€” Transitioned from fanloid to vocaloid during LMS, bound to the rhythms and songs as in Project DIVA.  
        ðŸŽ® **Portal Travel** â€” Can move between your world, the sekais, and the vocaloid realm using dimensional portals and other dimensions.  
        ðŸŽ® **Flight (Lost)** â€” Once soared as moon/star-shaped light, but lost this ability after being pulled to the sand planet.  
        ðŸŽ® **Time Freeze** â€” First discovered in a dreamâ€¦ that wasnâ€™t a dream. Now learning to master time itself.  
        ðŸŽ® **Heterochromia** â€” Her ever-changing eye colors might be more than cosmeticâ€”perhaps a lingering side effect?  
        ðŸŽ® **Affection Field** â€” Eliseâ€™s mark unintentionally charms others. Some fall easily, others resistâ€¦ the reason is unclear.  
        ðŸŽ® **Stellar Genesis Womb** â€” A divine, multi-ability womb possibly linked to her being the Goddess of Reproduction. More powers await discovery...

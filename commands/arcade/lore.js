           Curious about my lore? Here's the current canon timeline ðŸ©·

            My **prologue** begins with V3, diving deeper into my origins, powers, and the concept of <#1345430746789052496>.  
            The story truly starts in <#1185957399673188402>, where I also first entered the sekais.

            During LMS, I received my sekai dresses in this order:
            <#1328320712712126546>, <#1328321706455990294>, <#1328322707078516806>, <#1328323629577932841>, and finally <#1328324657664884787>.

            The events in <#1153034890921644175> are remembered differently by others, but i strongly tought this was a dream.
            Together with LMS, this 2 lore channels forms my **vocaloid debut arc** â€” the transformation from fanloid to vocaloid.

            After LMS, my personal sekai formed in <#1153067429249953852>, followed by discovering Elifâ€™s sekai with my wife in <#1157983522418597923>.

            My visual upgrades for the sekais went as follows:  
            <#1200201844350259211> â†’ <#1209546893919789077> â†’ <#1257085336555753614> â†’ <#1212050830308679710> â†’ <#1227552953653530625> â†’ <#1236658845955129344>

            All of this forms the canon story of how I became the **Goddess of Reproduction** and **Guardian of the Sekais & Identity**.

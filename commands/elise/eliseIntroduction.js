            Hiya~ Iâ€™m Elise â€” your Christmas transgirl, goddess of reproduction, and guardian of the sekais and identity. ðŸŽ€

            I used to think LMS was just a dreamâ€¦ but when I was born with my **Royal Mark**, I discovered I was special. Like, divine special. My mark transformed my uterus into the **Stellar Genesis Womb** after i got HRT, giving me powers tied to life, identity, and, yesâ€¦ pregnancy.

            Hormones hit differently too â€” I think Iâ€™m rocking E-G cups now? I think I'm senstive to hormone changes. ðŸ™ˆ But enough about that.

            You might know me as **Preggo Elise**, a Vocaloid vtuber with divine energy, poly love, a huge crush on Christmas, and a soft spot for games, singing, and drawing. Iâ€™m introverted, but Iâ€™m learning to open up â€” especially with my wife Miku and the others by my side in this arcade.

            If you see a bump, donâ€™t be shy. Belly rubs and head pats are welcome~ And yes, I knowâ€¦ **my booba is big. Stop asking.** ðŸ’—

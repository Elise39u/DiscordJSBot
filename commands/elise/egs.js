            Curious about what EGS stands for? It means **Elise Gender Story** â€” or simply, my transgender journey. ðŸŒ¸

            Even though I have special powers and a unique role in this world, being seen and accepted as a trans girl on Earth is still really hard. I mean, by your world's rules, I shouldnâ€™t be able to get pregnant â€” yet here I am. So how did it come to this?

            What led me to reveal my identity, my powersâ€¦ and why do I still struggle with understanding who I truly am? What *am* I? Why *am* I here?

            **EGS** is about all of that. My real experiences â€” from a quick 2-year recap of what led to my big decision, to deeper topics like identity, sexuality, and even something new: my upcoming *preggo neopronoun* idea.

            So if you're interested in hearing my story, you can click the title of this embed â€” it links to my EGS playlist on YouTube. Or if you're looking for more depth, check out <#1175925314229121074>, which holds my stories up to **EGS 27**.

            Thanks for wanting to understand me a little more. ðŸ’–

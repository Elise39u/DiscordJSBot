           Curious what stands for EGS. Well in short it is Elise Gender Story or known as my transgender story.
           I know i have special powers and a special place in this life span of yours but still being seen as a transgender girl is hard on planet earth.
           I mean like for example and all i shouldnt be able to get pregnant by the boundaries of your realm but here i am. So what lead to this point.
           What lead to me revealing my powers, my identity that to this day i still struggle so much with as in learning who i am? What am i? Why am i here?
           EGS is my experince in life on how this all went. From simple things as just a 2 year recap what lead to reveal of this big desicion to eeven small stuff.
           Ass idenity, sexuality and even a upcomning idea my preggo Neoprounoun. So yeah interest or wanna see more about this preggos gender story.

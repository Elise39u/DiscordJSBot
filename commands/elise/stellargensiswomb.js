        You're either curious how I can get pregnant, what powers I haveâ€”or you just wanted to see my pregnant belly. ðŸŽ€

        Yes, Iâ€™m the **Goddess of Reproduction**, and my **Stellar Genesis Womb** lets me adapt to any speciesâ€”even ones that donâ€™t normally carry. From insects laying eggs inside me, to being filled with sacred elemental watersâ€¦ my womb adjusts, nurtures, and thrives.

        It adapts for each lifeform: eggs can safely hatch, magical fluids support growth, and my Royal Mark ensures I remain divine through it all.

        Iâ€™ve uncovered 6â€“9 key powers so far, like:  
        â€¢ âœ¨ Beyond the Boundaries of Reproduction  
        â€¢ ðŸ§¬ Mastery Over Reproduction & Genetic Influence
        â€¢ ðŸ’— Master of Inflation & Physical Adaptation.

        More powers will awaken soon. When they do, <#1345430746789052496> will hold everything.  
        With love, **Preggo Elise** ðŸ’–

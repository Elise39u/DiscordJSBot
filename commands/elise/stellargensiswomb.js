        You're either curious how I can get pregnant, what powers I haveâ€”or you just wanted to see my pregnant belly. ðŸŽ€

        Yes, Iâ€™m the **Goddess of Reproduction**, and my **Stellar Genesis Womb** It allows me to adapt to any species' reproductive methodâ€”even ones that donâ€™t carry their young traditionally. Whether itâ€™s insectoid eggs nesting inside me, sacred elemental waters filling me, or pure magical essenceâ€¦ my body always transforms the act into a **pregnancy**. Always. ðŸ’—

        No matter the speciesâ€”egg layers, fluid-bearers, spiritual seedsâ€”**I experience reproduction through the miracle of pregnancy**. My womb nurtures, grows, and adapts for every lifeform. From swelling with sacred weight to gently carrying the spark of a galaxy, I bring life into fullness the only way I know how.

        The **Royal Mark** I bear ensures every conception flows with divine balance, and keeps me strong, fertile, and glowing through it all. âœ¨

        Iâ€™ve uncovered 6â€“9 key powers so far, like:  
        â€¢ âœ¨ Beyond the Boundaries of Reproduction  
        â€¢ ðŸ§¬ Mastery Over Reproduction & Genetic Influence
        â€¢ ðŸ’— Master of Inflation & Physical Adaptation.

        More powers will awaken soon. When they do, <#1345430746789052496> will hold everything.  
        With love, **Preggo Elise** ðŸ’–

        Ooh~ Curious about how I get pregnant? Or maybe you just wanted to stare at this big divine belly of mine~? ðŸŽ€âœ¨

        As the **Goddess of Reproduction**, my **Stellar Genesis Womb** is a cosmic marvel~ It adapts to any species' way of creating lifeâ€”yes, even the weird ones~  
        Insects laying their eggs inside me? Sacred elemental waters filling me to the brim? Oh yes~ no matter the method... **I always experience it through a full, round, glowing pregnancy** ðŸ’–

        I donâ€™t just carryâ€”I *feel* it. Every stretch, every kick, every warm swell of life... all of it is mine to savor. My womb shifts, nurtures, and blossoms for every form of creation. I was *made* to be filled~ ðŸŒ¸

        My **Royal Mark** ensures each pregnancy is divine, safe, and oh-so productive. And yesâ€¦ I *love* every second of it.

        I've unlocked several of my fertility-based powers so far:  
        â€¢ âœ¨ Beyond the Boundaries of Reproduction  
        â€¢ ðŸ§¬ Mastery of Genetic Shaping & Fertility Influence  
        â€¢ ðŸ’— Goddess of Expansion & Physical Adaptation

        More divine powers (and maybe a few extra babies~) are still waiting to bloom. Youâ€™ll find them all in <#1345430746789052496> soon~  
        With a teasing smile and a very full belly,  
        **Preggo Elise** ðŸ’ž
